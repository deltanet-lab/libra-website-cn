When we built the Libra Blockchain, security was top of mind. If people are going to rely on Libra for their everyday financial needs, it is critical that the infrastructure behind it be dependable and safe. This is one of the reasons we shared our plans well in advance of launch and open-sourced an early-stage version of the Libra Blockchain code, Libra Core, under an Apache 2.0 License. This testnet will help us gather feedback from the community about the direction of the project and work toward ensuring a scalable, reliable, and secure launch.

当我们构建天秤座区块链时，安全是第一要务。如果人们要依靠Libra来满足其日常财务需求，那么其背后的基础设施必须可靠且安全至关重要。这是我们在发布前就很好地共享计划并根据Apache 2.0许可证开放了Libra区块链代码的早期版本Libra Core的原因之一。该测试网将帮助我们从社区中收集有关项目方向的反馈，并努力确保可扩展，可靠和安全的启动。

Another way to gather feedback and reinforce the security of the Libra Blockchain is through a bug bounty. **Today we are excited to announce the launch of the Libra Bug Bounty program, which is open to security researchers around the world.** You can find more information about the program [here](https://hackerone.com/libra).

收集反馈并加强天秤座区块链安全性的另一种方法是通过漏洞赏金。 **今天，我们很高兴宣布推出面向全球安全研究人员的Libra Bug Bounty程序。**您可以在[此处](https://hackerone.com/libra)找到有关该程序的更多信息。

We kicked off our bug bounty efforts as soon as we announced the plans for Libra, on June 18th, with a beta bug bounty program. We invited 50 security researchers with blockchain expertise and encouraged their deep scrutiny of the platform. This helped us fine-tune and tweak the program before opening it up more broadly.

我们在6月18日宣布了针对Libra的计划后，便开始了我们的漏洞赏金工作，并推出了beta的bug赏金计划。我们邀请了50位具有区块链专业知识的安全研究人员，并鼓励他们深入研究该平台。这有助于我们在更广泛地打开程序之前对其进行微调和调整。

Now that the program is open to the public, we hope to further accelerate and expand this feedback loop. Our rewards program is designed to encourage members of the security community to dig deep, helping us find even the most subtle bugs. We want to help our researchers uncover issues while the Libra Blockchain is still in testnet and no real money is in circulation. Participants can receive up to $10,000 in rewards for discovering the most critical issues.

现在该程序已向公众开放，我们希望进一步加速和扩展此反馈循环。我们的奖励计划旨在鼓励安全社区成员深入研究，甚至帮助我们发现最细微的错误。我们想帮助我们的研究人员在天秤座区块链仍处于测试网中并且没有任何实际资金流通时发现问题。参与者发现最关键的问题可获得高达10,000美元的奖励。

Bug bounties are a well-established way to encourage members of the security community to detect and report security vulnerabilities in exchange for potential rewards. And it’s not just for blockchains. Many companies across industries have bug bounty programs of their own to help encourage developers to report security issues with their respective technologies.

漏洞赏金是鼓励安全社区成员检测并报告安全漏洞以换取潜在奖励的一种行之有效的方法。而且不仅仅适用于区块链。各行各业的许多公司都有自己的漏洞赏金计划，以帮助鼓励开发人员报告其各自技术的安全问题。

With the launch of the Libra Bug Bounty, we are excited to build an open and vibrant network of security and privacy researchers around the globe. We know it will take a global community to launch a global cryptocurrency, and we are committed to taking the time to get this right.

随着“Libra的漏洞赏金计划”的启动，我们很高兴在全球范围内建立一个开放而充满活力的安全和隐私研究人员网络。我们知道，要启动全球加密货币需要一个全球社区，并且我们致力于花一些时间来实现这一目标。
